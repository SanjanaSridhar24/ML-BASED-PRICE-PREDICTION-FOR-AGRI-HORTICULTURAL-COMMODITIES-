# ML-BASED-PRICE-PREDICTION-FOR-AGRI-HORTICULTURAL-COMMODITIES-
A Streamlit web app that predicts prices of **21 agri-horticultural commodities** using **10+ years of market and weather data**. The project leverages **ARIMA and SARIMAX models**, validated with **AIC/BIC** and evaluated with **RMSE & F1 score** for reliable forecasts

## Introduction
Agricultural commodity prices fluctuate due to multiple factors like arrivals, demand, and weather.  
This project helps farmers, traders, and policymakers by predicting **future prices** with statistical models trained on over 10 years of market and weather data.

## Features
- Predicts prices for **21 commodities** (e.g., potato, dry chilies, garlic, etc.)
- Uses **ARIMA & SARIMAX** models for time-series forecasting
- Incorporates **market and weather data**
- Interactive **Streamlit web app interface**
- Statistical validation (**AIC, BIC**) & evaluation (**RMSE, F1 Score**)

## Tech Stack
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMAX)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection (market & weather data for 10+ years)  
2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
3. Model Training (ARIMA, SARIMAX)  
4. Model Validation (AIC, BIC)  
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, F1 Score)  
6. Deployment on Streamlit  

## Results
- Forecasted price trends for 21 commodities
- Improved accuracy using SARIMAX over ARIMA

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset with real-time APIs
- Try advanced ML/DL models (LSTM, Prophet)
- Add visualization dashboards
